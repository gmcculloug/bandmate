# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Common Development Commands

### Database Management
- **Setup database**: `rake db:setup` (runs migrations + seeds)
- **Create PostgreSQL database**: `createdb bandmate_development` and `createdb bandmate_test`
- **Create migration**: `rake db:create_migration NAME=migration_name`
- **Run migrations**: `rake db:migrate`
- **Check migration status**: `rake db:status`
- **Rollback last migration**: `rake db:rollback`
- **Reset database**: `rake db:reset` (drops all tables, re-runs migrations)
- **Seed database**: `rake db:seed`

### Testing
- **Run all tests**: `rake spec` or `rspec`
- **Run specific test file**: `rspec spec/models/band_spec.rb`
- **Run tests with coverage**: `rake test:coverage`
- **Run tests with HTML output**: `rake test:html`

### Application
- **Start development server**: `ruby app.rb` (runs on http://localhost:4567)
- **Install dependencies**: `bundle install`

### Docker Commands
- **Start with Docker Compose**: `docker-compose up -d` (includes PostgreSQL)
- **Stop Docker services**: `docker-compose down`
- **View logs**: `docker-compose logs -f bandmate`
- **Run migrations in Docker**: `docker-compose exec bandmate bundle exec rake db:migrate`
- **Access PostgreSQL in Docker**: `docker-compose exec postgres psql -U bandmate -d bandmate_production`

## Architecture Overview

### Application Structure
- **Single-file Sinatra app**: All models, routes, and configuration in `app.rb`
- **ERB templates**: Located in `views/` directory
- **PostgreSQL database**: Uses ActiveRecord ORM with custom migration system
- **Test suite**: RSpec with FactoryBot, Capybara for integration tests

### Core Models and Relationships
- **Band**: Has many songs (many-to-many), has many set lists
- **Song**: Belongs to many bands, appears in set lists through join table
- **SetList**: Belongs to band and venue, has many songs through SetListSong
- **Venue**: Has many set lists
- **SetListSong**: Join table with position ordering for songs in set lists

### Database Configuration
- Development: `bandmate_development` PostgreSQL database
- Test: `bandmate_test` PostgreSQL database
- Production: Uses `DATABASE_URL` environment variable or individual PostgreSQL connection env vars
- Environment variables: `DATABASE_HOST`, `DATABASE_PORT`, `DATABASE_NAME`, `DATABASE_USERNAME`, `DATABASE_PASSWORD`

### Custom Migration System
This project implements a custom migration system (not Rails migrations):
- Migrations in `db/migrate/` with timestamp_name.rb format
- Custom rake tasks handle migration state tracking
- Always use `rake db:create_migration` to generate new migrations
- Migration classes must inherit from `ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]`

### Testing Setup
- Tests clear all data before each spec
- FactoryBot provides test data factories
- Capybara configured for integration testing
- Database cleaner ensures test isolation

### Key Features
- Band management with song libraries
- Set list creation and organization
- Venue tracking with contact information
- Mobile-responsive design
- Print-friendly set list views
- Performance scheduling

## Development Guidelines

### Database Changes
- Always create migrations for schema changes: `rake db:create_migration NAME=descriptive_name`
- Never modify database directly
- Test migrations on copy of production data before applying

### Testing
- All models have comprehensive specs in `spec/models/`
- Request specs cover all routes in `spec/requests/`
- Use factories for test data creation
- Clean database state between tests

### Adding New Features
1. Create migration if database changes needed
2. Update models with validations and associations
3. Add routes and views
4. Write comprehensive tests
5. Ensure mobile responsiveness
