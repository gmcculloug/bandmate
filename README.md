## Customization

### Adding New Song Properties

2. Update the Song model validations if needed
3. Add form fields to `new_song.erb` and `edit_song.erb`
4. Update display templates as needed

### Styling
The application uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive design. Styles are included in `views/layout.erb` and can be customized there.

## Troubleshooting

### Database Issues
If you encounter database errors:
1. Delete the `bandage.db` file
2. Restart the application
3. Visit `http://localhost:4567/setup` to recreate the database

### Port Already in Use
If port 4567 is already in use, you can change it by modifying the last line in `app.rb`:
```ruby
set :port, 4569  # or any other available port
```

## Docker Deployment

### Quick Start with Docker
```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose (recommended)
docker-compose up -d

# Or build and run manually
docker build -t bandage .
docker run -p 4567:4567 -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data bandage
```

### Docker Features
- **Persistent Database**: Database is stored in `./data` directory
- **Health Checks**: Automatic health monitoring
- **Security**: Runs as non-root user
- **Production Ready**: Optimized for production deployment

### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_PATH`: Path to SQLite database file (default: `bandage.db`)
- `RACK_ENV`: Environment mode (default: `production`)
- `PORT`: Application port (default: `4567`)

### Database Setup
After starting the container, visit `http://localhost:4567/setup` to initialize the database and create a default band.
